# Python Package Installation

When installing Python packages:

1. Always check latest version first using `pip index versions <package>` or PyPI
2. Then install with the verified latest version

This ensures:
- Installing up-to-date packages
- Avoiding outdated cached versions
- Explicit version awareness before installation
