# SQL Optimization - Advanced Techniques

## Materialized Views

Pre-compute expensive queries.

```sql
-- Create materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_order_summary AS
SELECT
    u.id,
    u.name,
    COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total) as total_spent,
    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name;

-- Add index to materialized view
CREATE INDEX idx_user_summary_spent ON user_order_summary(total_spent DESC);

-- Refresh materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW user_order_summary;

-- Concurrent refresh (PostgreSQL)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_order_summary;

-- Query materialized view (very fast)
SELECT * FROM user_order_summary
WHERE total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

## Partitioning

Split large tables for better performance.

```sql
-- Range partitioning by date (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL,
    user_id INT,
    total DECIMAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q1 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');

CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q2 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');

-- Queries automatically use appropriate partition
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28';
-- Only scans orders_2024_q1 partition
```

## Query Hints and Optimization

```sql
-- Force index usage (MySQL)
SELECT * FROM users
USE INDEX (idx_users_email)
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Parallel query (PostgreSQL)
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition;

-- Join hints (PostgreSQL)
SET enable_nestloop = OFF;  -- Force hash or merge join
```

## Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Find slow queries (PostgreSQL)
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Find missing indexes (PostgreSQL)
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    idx_scan,
    seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg_seq_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 0
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Find unused indexes (PostgreSQL)
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE users;
ANALYZE VERBOSE orders;

-- Vacuum (PostgreSQL)
VACUUM ANALYZE users;
VACUUM FULL users;  -- Reclaim space (locks table)

-- Reindex
REINDEX INDEX idx_users_email;
REINDEX TABLE users;
```
